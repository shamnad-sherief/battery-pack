# Using Battery Packs

## The TUI

The primary way to interact with battery packs is the terminal UI.
Run `cargo bp` with no arguments:

```bash
cargo bp
```

The TUI is context-dependent. If you're inside a Rust project, you'll see:

- **Your installed battery packs** — toggle individual crates on and off,
  change dependency kinds, enable features
- **Browse** — search and add new battery packs from crates.io
- **New project** — create a project from a battery pack template

If you're not in a Rust project, the installed-packs section is
greyed out, but you can still browse and create new projects.

## Non-interactive mode

Pass `--non-interactive` (or `-N`) to suppress TUI and prompts:

```bash
cargo bp -N list                        # plain text output
cargo bp -N show cli                    # plain text output
cargo bp -N new cli --name my-app       # no prompts
cargo bp -N rm cli                      # skip "remove deps?" prompt
```

Set `CARGO_BP_NON_INTERACTIVE=true` to activate for an entire session:

```bash
export CARGO_BP_NON_INTERACTIVE=true
cargo bp list              # plain text, no TUI
cargo bp new cli -n my-app # no prompts
```

For `new`, use `--name` and `-d` to provide values that would otherwise be prompted:

```bash
cargo bp new cli --name my-app -d description="My CLI tool"
```

## Browsing available packs

### From the TUI

The Browse tab in the TUI lets you search crates.io for battery packs.
Select one to see its contents — which crates it includes, what features
it offers, and what templates are available.

### From the command line

```bash
cargo bp list              # list all battery packs
cargo bp list cli          # filter by name
cargo bp show cli          # detailed view of cli-battery-pack
```

## Adding a battery pack

### Basic add

```bash
cargo bp add cli
```

This adds the battery pack's **default** crates to your project.
Which crates are "default" is determined by the battery pack author
(see [Features](#features) below).

### Adding with features

```bash
cargo bp add cli -F indicators
```

This adds the default crates plus the crates from the `indicators` feature.
You can also write `--features indicators`, or enable multiple features
with `-F indicators,fancy` or repeated `-F indicators -F fancy`.

### Adding with no defaults

```bash
cargo bp add cli --no-default-features -F indicators
```

This adds only the `indicators` feature's crates, skipping the defaults.

### Adding everything

```bash
cargo bp add cli --all-features
```

This adds every crate the battery pack offers, regardless of defaults or features.

### Adding specific crates

```bash
cargo bp add cli clap indicatif
```

This adds just the named crates from the battery pack.

## Features

Battery packs use Cargo's `[features]` to group related crates.
For example, `cli-battery-pack` might define:

```toml
[features]
default = ["clap", "dialoguer"]
indicators = ["indicatif", "console"]
fancy = ["clap", "indicatif", "console"]
```

- **default** — the crates you get with a plain `cargo bp add cli`
- **indicators** — progress bars and console styling
- **fancy** — argument parsing with color support, plus indicators

Features are additive. Enabling `indicators` on top of `default` gives you
all four crates. A feature can also augment the Cargo features of a crate
that's already included (e.g., adding the `color` feature to `clap`).

In the TUI, features appear as toggleable groups alongside individual crate toggles.

## Dependency kinds

By default, each crate is added with the same dependency kind it has in the
battery pack's Cargo.toml:

- A crate listed in the battery pack's `[dev-dependencies]` becomes a
  `[dev-dependencies]` entry in your project
- A crate in `[dependencies]` becomes a regular dependency
- A crate in `[build-dependencies]` becomes a build dependency

You can override this in the TUI — for instance, promoting a dev-dependency
to a regular dependency, or vice versa.

## Keeping in sync

### Checking status

```bash
cargo bp status
```

This shows your installed battery packs and highlights any mismatches.
If a battery pack recommends `clap 4.5` but you have `clap 4.3`, you'll
see a warning. Having a *newer* version than recommended is fine.

### Syncing

```bash
cargo bp sync
```

This updates your dependencies to match the installed battery packs:

- Bumps versions that are older than what the battery pack recommends
- Adds features the battery pack has added since your last sync
- Adds new crates if they've been added to your active features

Sync is non-destructive — it only adds and upgrades, never removes.

## Workspaces

When your crate is part of a Cargo workspace, `cargo bp` is workspace-aware:

- A `battery-pack.toml` is created next to each crate's `Cargo.toml`
  to track installed packs, active features, and managed dependencies
- Dependencies are added to `[workspace.dependencies]` and referenced
  as `crate = { workspace = true }` in the crate's `[dependencies]`

This keeps versions centralized and consistent across workspace members.

## Local sources

You can point `cargo bp` at a local workspace containing battery packs
instead of (or in addition to) crates.io. This is useful for:

- **Testing** — validate your battery pack before publishing
- **Organizations** — maintain internal battery packs in a monorepo
- **Development** — iterate on a battery pack alongside the project using it

```bash
cargo bp --source ../my-battery-packs add cli
cargo bp --source ../my-battery-packs
```

The `--source` flag takes a path to a Cargo workspace. `cargo bp`
discovers all `*-battery-pack` crates within it automatically.
Local sources take precedence over crates.io, so if both have
`cli-battery-pack`, the local one wins.

You can combine multiple sources:

```bash
cargo bp --source ../team-packs --source ../my-packs list
```

For a single battery pack directory (not a workspace), use `--path`:

```bash
cargo bp add my-pack --path ../my-battery-pack
```

## Multiple battery packs

A project can use multiple battery packs. State is tracked in
`battery-pack.toml` next to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
version = 1

[[battery-pack]]
name = "error"
features = ["default"]

[[battery-pack.managed-deps]]
name = "anyhow"
version = "1"

[[battery-pack.managed-deps]]
name = "thiserror"
version = "2"

[[battery-pack]]
name = "cli"
features = ["default"]

[[battery-pack.managed-deps]]
name = "clap"
version = "4"
```

Each battery pack tracks its own metadata. If two battery packs
recommend the same crate with different features, the features are
merged (unioned) — this is always safe.
